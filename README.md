# Dual Build with Shared Library

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` for the build of code located in the src-a folder. `http://localhost:5200/` is where the src-b build resides. The apps will automatically reload if you change any of the source files in their respective directories.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/a` and `dist/b` directories. Both build have the production flag set as the default.
